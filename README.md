###### exploring **terraform provisioners** based on **research**

- expoloring provisioners with an EC2 instance and security group to access via ssh + http inbound request
- installing nginx on the instance via shell script (file provisioner to transfer scrip into local image and remote exec
to run the nginx)
- custom table association and internet gateway applied.
- security best practices applied with aws_key_pair

###### Note: main.tf is just a testing playground ðŸ¤
